 We know that smart contracts on Ethereum are not upgradeable, as the code is immutable and cannot be changed once it is deployed. But writing perfect code the first time around is hard, and as humans we are all prone to making mistakes. Sometimes even contracts which have been audited turn out to have bugs that cost them millions.

 Smart contract deployed using #OpenZeppelin Upgrade Plugins can be upgraded to modify their code ,while preserving their Address,state and Balance.

 This allows you to iteratively add new features to your project, or fix any bug you may find in production.
